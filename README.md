# Calculator Java Project

This is a Java project that implements a `Calculator` class with a `findAverage` method.
 The `findAverage` method calculates the average of three numbers and returns the result rounded to two decimal digits.
## Usage

To use the `Calculator` class, follow these steps:

1. Create an instance of the `Calculator` class.
2. Call the `findAverage` method with three numbers as arguments.
3. The method will return the average rounded to two decimal digits.

```java
Calculator calculator = new Calculator();
double num1 = 65;
double num2 = 175;
double num3 = num1 / num2;
double average = calculator.findAverage(num1, num2, num3);

```Sample Input and Output

double num1 = 65;
double num2 = 175;
double num3 = num1 / num2;
System.out.println(Math.round(num3 * 100.0) / 100.0);
